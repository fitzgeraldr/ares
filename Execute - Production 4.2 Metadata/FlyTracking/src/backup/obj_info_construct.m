% Note on frame-indexed quantities.
% The obj_info fields num_active, data, x, and y are indexed first by
% object number, then by frame. Since a single tracking session typically
% involves using/saving multiple obj_infos, numFrm is typically less than
% the total number of frames in the video sequence being tracked.
% Frame-indexed obj_info fields are therefore indexed by "relative frame"
% where an idx of 1 indicates the first frame covered by the obj_info.
% Serialized obj_infos involve a further twist (see xxx).

% Number of tracks active in each frame.

% Data matrix for each tracked object. Currently, this data is a vector 
% with the object orientation per frame.

% The fields start_frame and end_frame record the *absolute* start/end
% frame index for a track. Note however that serialized obj_infos may not
% have a fully updated end_frame value (see xxx).
