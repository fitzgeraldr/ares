%%%% Example paramter file for OlympiadTrak
%%  Possible parameters are:
%%     workDir      Specify a working directory if different then current one
%%                  All input/output files are searched under this directory 
%%     inputFile    Can handle either an avi file or a sequence of jpeg images
%%                  For images we require the format e.g., JPG/image.%04d.jpg 
%%                  For an avi file, just its name.
%%                  This is relative to the workDir.
%%     roiPath      The path to the ROI.txt file, if used
%%     bgFile       Name of background image file - relative to workDir.
%%     roiFile	    Name of ROI image file - relative to workDir.
%%     outputDir    Output directory - relative to workDir
%%     startFrame   Index of first frame to process 
%%     endFrame     Index of last frame to process
%%     genVideoOutput       A switch (0/1) for generating video output 
%%     updateBg             A switch (0/1) for re-estimating the background image
%%     updateRoi            If no ROI specified in the bmp file, then a value of 0 means the entire image is in the ROI, 1 means use ROI.txt
%%     displayTracking      A switch (0/1) for on-line display of tracking
%%     moveThresh           Threshold  for which translation in pixels 
%%                          is considered as "moving".
%%     frameRate            For a sequence of images we need the frame rate
%%                          If the input is an avi the frame-rate is taken
%%                          from it.
%%     tubeToProcess        Which tubes are to be processed:
%%                             all   =  all tubes will be processed
%%                              0    =  all tubes will be processed
%%                             index =  process tube number "index" 
%%                                      counting is left-to-right
%%                             -1    =  select manually
%%                          to process multiple tubes use this entry
%%                          several times
